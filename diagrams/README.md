# Diagrams for the project paper


Please note that 

* the diagrams use the LaTeX package TikZ and were initially generated with TikZiT

* and then tweaked by hand as the program lacks a few features, e.g. scaling of elements, textboxes, etc.

* they can/should be edited with your favourite text editor

* to compile use `pdflatex` 

* use `pdfcrop` to remove unwanted whitespaces
